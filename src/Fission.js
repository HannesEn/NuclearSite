      <h3>Discovery</h3>
      <p>
      In the december of 1938 at the <a href="https://www.mpic.de/3537786/Overview">Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Chemistry</a> in Germany whilst bombarding uranium atoms with neutrons Otto Hahn and Fritz Straßmann discovered that the mass of the product was less than that of the reactants(uranium and a neutron). This was the first time that nuclear fission was observed.
      </p>
      <p>
        This caused major confusion due to the law of conservation of mass.
      </p>
      <p className='law'>
        "Mass can nither be created nor destroyed, it can only be converted from one form to another."
      </p>
      <p>
      The explanation came a month later when two colleagues of Otto and Fritz, <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lise_Meitner'>Lise Meitner </a> and <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otto_Robert_Frisch'>Otto Frisch</a>, proved that the nucleus of the uranium atom split into two.
      </p>
      <p>
     Lise Meitner was of Jewish descent and had to flee Germany due to the rise of the Nazi regime in the 1930s. She was forced to leave her research behind and flee to Sweden. She continued to work with Otto Frisch her nephue and they published their findings in the journal Nature. Otto Frisch later worked on the british atomic bomb project by designing the first theoretical detonator.
      </p>
      <p>
        The splitting of the uranium nucleus releases a large amount of energy and more neutrons. These neutrons can then go on to split other uranium nuclei, creating a chain reaction. This release of energy accounts for the lost mass.
      </p>
      <p>
        Einstein's famous equation E=mc^2 relates mass and energy as part of his <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_relativity'>theory of special relativity</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
      According to available resources, the mass of a singular uranium 235 atom plus 1 neutron is 236.133 atomic mass units, and the product of that reaction has a mass of 235.919 atomic mass units. We can calculate the difference and then plug the values into Einstein’s formula. E = 0.214u×(3.00×10^8 m/s)^2 as c = the speed of light in a vacuum. First we will need to convert the atomic mass units to kilograms, as required by the formula. This means that a singular fission reaction releases roughly 3.21147×10^−11 Joules
      </p>
      <p>
        This might not seem like much, but when you consider that a gram of uranium contains billions of atoms, the energy released is substantial. The average nuclear fission reacotr has roughlu 31 billion reactions per second, producing about one gigawattr of power per second. This means that about 5 standard nuclear fission reactors can power all of Sydney.
      </p>
      <h3>Technology</h3>
      <p>
        A nuclear fission reactor is a complex system that controls the chain reaction of splitting uranium nuclei. 
      </p>
      <p className='law'><span className='three'>3</span> major components</p>
     <p className='law'>
            Fuel Elements | Moderator | Control rods
     </p>
     <p>
     Fuel elements usually come in the form of long dense rods that are about 1 cm in diameter. These rods contain the fuel either uranium or plutonium, with uranium being the most common. Nuclear reactors usually contain more than 10 000 of these rods separated into rod assemblies.
     </p>
        <p>
        A commonly used moderator is heavy water, which instead of regular hydrogen contains the heavier deuterium isotope. The fuel rods are submerged in the moderator.  The purpose of the moderator is to slow down the neutrons which are ejected from the fission reaction. Slowed neutrons are more likely to hit other uranium nuclei, which is required for a nuclear chain reaction to occur. Heavy water is used because it is able to sufficiently slow neutrons down without absorbing them.
        </p>
        <p>
        In order to control the number and frequency of nuclear fission reactions, control rods are inserted into the reactor. These control rods are typically made of materials like Cadmium. These materials will absorb neutrons. Additional control rods can be added or removed to vary the number of absorption events.
        </p>
<p>
Within research reactors in some instances all control rods are quickly removed, for extreme radiation event testing. This rapid withdrawal of control rods is called reactor pulsing.

</p>
<p>
As nuclear fission takes place, the fuel rods become extremely hot, as one end of the rods is in the reactor core, the other is submerged in a coolant, commonly water. This coolant then moves to a steam generator, where it turns to steam. This steem spins a turbine connected to a generator. A separate condenser system turns used steam back into water. The condenser system is connected to a cooling tower which then releases proportionally less steam.
</p>
<p>
Steam does not harm the environment.  
</p> 
<p>
    In the end energy is converted from nuclear energy to heat energy, into kinetic energy through steam, which turns into magnetic and then electrical energy within the generator
</p>
      <h3>Issues</h3>
      <p>
      But there are downsides too. A major challenge is the management of nuclear waste although most of the world's nuclear waste is contained within secure storage facilities, it will remain radioactive for thousands of years which creates further challenges in ensuring future safety for storage sites. Although there are promising developments in fast neutron reactors which could use spent nuclear fuel, these technologies are not yet fully developed and their success remains uncertain. Thus nuclear fission can neither be classified as a renewable nor a non-renewable source of power.
      </p>
      <p>
      There is also the problem of nuclear proliferation. The same technology that can be used to generate power can also be used to create nuclear weapons.

      </p>
      <p>
      Both the Uranium and/or Plutonium used in nuclear reactors is weapons-grade meaning it can be used to build an atomic bomb.
      </p>
      <p>
      This factor significantly limits the spread of nuclear fission energy. Nuclear proliferation is the spreading of nuclear weapons.
      </p>
      <p>
      There are independent international agencies which conduct site visits to ensure countries comply with international law, like the <a href='https://isis-online.org/'>Institute for Science and International Security</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
      Yes, you read that right an organisation focused on international security calls themselves ISIS.
      </p>
      <p>
      The Paranoja of world powers like the United States is so large on this matter that in 2010 the United States launched a <a href='https://www.amazon.com.au/Countdown-Zero-Day-Kim-Zetter/dp/0770436196'>classified cyber attack</a> on the industrial control systems of an Iranian nuclear power plant’s uranium enrichment centrifuges, due to a suspicion of enriching materials for weapons.

      </p>
      <p>
      Yet even with the risk of nuclear proliferation there are currently 32 countries globally which operate nuclear reactors for power generation and only 9 countries that have nuclear weapons.
      </p>
      <h3>Australia</h3>
      <p>
      When it comes to Australia it is complicated. Although Australia does not currently possess nuclear power stations, it does have a single nuclear reactor in south sydney, solely focused on medical and scientific research.
      </p>
      <p>
      Furthermore the AUKUS submarine deal will involve Australia's acquisition of at least 3 virginia-class nuclear submarines and the development of a new SSN-Aukus Nuclear submarine class co-developed by the United Kingdom and Australia.
      </p>
      <h3>Saftey</h3>
      <p>
      Although widely popularised reactor malfunctions like three mile islands, Chernobyl and Fokushima may make nuclear fission seem like a dangerous power source this is far from the truth. All these incidents were caused by human error within the design or operatrion of a plant and not the technology itself. For example in the reactor meltdown of three mile island, there was a failure in the secondary cooling system which isn't even part of the reactor core.
      </p>
      <p>
      Today Nuclear Fission is the World's safest source of energy. Resulting in 99.9% less deaths than from brown coal, the world's most dangerous energy source. And being almost two times safer than wind, the World’s second safest energy source.
      </p>
      <p>
      Nuclear fission provides roughly 10% of the world’s energy, yet this number refuses to grow because of the mentioned issues surrounding nuclear proliferation and lack of public trust but also because it is cheaper to use energy sources that are more harmful to the environment, less safe and less reliable. Nuclear fission simply doesn’t seem to fit the narrative.
